Purpose:

To help people determine whether a rental property is safe and affordable so that they can make better rental decisions. Shambles will help fill the gap between renters and the real information about the property they are renting.

People (target market):

We are currently focusing on ‘Students in Wellington' and comparing Wellington data with Christchurch.

The reasons we have selected students as our (first) target market are:

1.      They are frequently moving and therefore have a high demand for this information

2.      They are often moving to a different town which they don’t know well and therefore they need more visibility

Problem:

Some rental information is available but is scattered e.g. earthquake-stickered properties, some information which renters would be looking for is not available until you visit a property e.g. cold or dark, and still more information is not available until you have been in a property for some time e.g. the helpfulness of the landlord, damp conditions or noisy neighbors.

Through a qualitative survey, our own experience and anecdotal stories of target customers, we have heard about the lack of transparency on the safety and affordability of rental properties at a local and national level.
